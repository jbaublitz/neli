//! This module provides code that glues all of the other modules
//! together and allows message send and receive operations.
//!
//! ## Important methods
//! * [`NlSocket::send`][crate::socket::NlSocket::send] and
//! [`NlSocket::recv`][crate::socket::NlSocket::recv] methods are meant to
//! be the most low level calls. They essentially do what the C
//! system calls `send` and `recv` do with very little abstraction.
//! * [`NlSocketHandle::send`][crate::socket::NlSocket::send] and
//! [`NlSocketHandle::recv`][crate::socket::NlSocket::recv] methods
//! are meant to provide an interface that is more idiomatic for
//! the library.
//!
//! ## Features
//! The `async` feature exposed by `cargo` allows the socket to use
//! Rust's [tokio](https://tokio.rs) for async IO.
//!
//! ## Additional methods
//!
//! There are methods for blocking and non-blocking, resolving
//! generic netlink multicast group IDs, and other convenience
//! functions so see if your use case is supported. If it isn't,
//! please open a Github issue and submit a feature request.
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! The buffer allocated in the [`BufferPool`][crate::utils::synchronous::BufferPool]
//! structure should be allocated on the heap. This is intentional as a buffer
//! that large could be a problem on the stack.
