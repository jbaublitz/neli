# neli
Type safe netlink library for Rust

As of version 0.4.0, completeness of autogenerated documentation
and examples will be a focus. Please open issues if something is
missing or unclear!

## API documentation
API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rs/neli/)

## Goals

This library aims to cover as many of the netlink subsystems as
possible and provide ways to extend neli for anything that is not
within the scope of support for this library.

This is also a pure Rust implementation and aims to make use of
idiomatic Rust features.

## Examples using `neli`

Examples of working code exist in the `examples/` subdirectory on
Github. Run `cargo build --examples` to build the examples. 

Workflows usually follow a pattern of socket creation, and
then either sending and receiving messages in request/response
formats:

```rust
use std::error::Error;

use neli::{
    consts::{genl::*, nl::*, socket::*},
    err::RouterError,
    genl::{Genlmsghdr, GenlmsghdrBuilder, Nlattr},
    nl::{NlmsghdrBuilder, NlPayload},
    router::synchronous::NlRouter,
    types::{Buffer, GenlBuffer},
    utils::Groups,
};

const GENL_VERSION: u8 = 1;

fn request_response() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let (socket, _) = NlRouter::connect(
        NlFamily::Generic,
        None,
        Groups::empty(),
    )?;

    let recv = socket.send::<_, _, NlTypeWrapper, Genlmsghdr<CtrlCmd, CtrlAttr>>(
        GenlId::Ctrl,
        NlmF::DUMP,
        NlPayload::Payload(
            GenlmsghdrBuilder::<_, CtrlAttr, _>::default()
                .cmd(CtrlCmd::Getfamily)
                .version(GENL_VERSION)
                .build()?
        ),
    )?;
    
    for msg in recv {
        let msg = msg?;
        // Do things with response here...
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

or a subscriptions to a stream of event notifications from netlink:

```rust
use std::error::Error;

use neli::{
    consts::{genl::*, nl::*, socket::*},
    err::RouterError,
    genl::Genlmsghdr,
    router::synchronous::NlRouter,
    utils::Groups,
};

fn subscribe_to_mcast() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let (s, multicast) = NlRouter::connect(
        NlFamily::Generic,
        None,
        Groups::empty(),
    )?;
    let id = s.resolve_nl_mcast_group(
        "my_family_name",
        "my_multicast_group_name",
    )?;
    s.add_mcast_membership(Groups::new_groups(&[id]))?;
    for next in multicast {
        // Do stuff here with parsed packets...
    
        // like printing a debug representation of them:
        println!("{:?}", next?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## Contributing

Your contribution will be licensed under neli's [license](LICENSE).
I want to keep this aspect as simple as possible so please read over
the license file prior to contributing to make sure that you feel
comfortable with your contributions being released under the BSD
3-Clause License.

Please add tests for new features wherever possible.  I may request this
prior to merge if I see it is possible and missing.

Please document new features not just at a lower level but also with
`//!` comments at the module for high level documentation and
overview of the feature.

Before submitting PRs, take a look at the module's documentation that
you are changing. I am currently in the process of adding a "Design
decision" section to each module. If you are wondering why I did
something the way I did, it should be there. That way, if you have a
better way to do it, please let me know! I'm always happy to learn.
My hope is that this will also clarify some questions beforehand
about why I did things the way I did and will make your life as a
contributer easier.

### Git hooks

I've provided git hooks to simulate a subset of what CI is running.
If you'd like to enable these, they'll probably catch some errors
before having to look at CI. If you'd like to enable these, run
`git config core.hookspath .githooks`. Your commits will be checked
before the commit is created.

### PR target branch

Steps for a PR:
* For bug fixes and improvements that are not breaking changes,
please target `main`.
* For breaking changes, please target the branch for the next version
release - this will look like `v[NEXT_VERSION]-dev`
* Please include a brief description of your change in the CHANGELOG
file
* Once a PR has been reviewed and approved, please rebase onto the
target branch
  * For those less familiar with git, it should look something like
this
    * `git rebase [TARGET_BRANCH] [YOUR_BRANCH]`
    * _This is a destructive operation so make sure you check carefully before doing this_: `git push -f origin [YOUR_BRANCH]`
