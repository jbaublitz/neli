# neli
Type safe netlink library for Rust

As of version 0.4.0, completeness of autogenerated documentation and examples will be a focus.
Please open issues if something is missing or unclear!

## API documentation
API documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rs/neli/0.4.2/neli/)

## Goals

This library aims to cover as many of the netlink subsystems as possible and provide ways
to extend neli for anything that is not within the scope of support for this library.

This is also a pure Rust implementation and aims to make use of idiomatic Rust features.

## Design decisions

This is a very low level library. It aims to give the user control over every aspect of
the protocol and while a higher level API is in the works for this project, currently
it relies on a serialization and deserialization workflow of packets. A socket handle
is provided with convenience functions to ease some of the manual aspects of common
workflows.

At the heart of `neli` is the `Nl` trait which allows you to serialize and deserialize as
well as calculate the buffer size needed to serialize the netlink packet. This can be implemented
for user-defined types as well and used extensibly with `neli`. `libc` constants are wrapped
in enums for more intuitive matching of flags and constants with struct fields that accept them.

Currently supported subsystems are:
* genetlink - The generic netlink subsystem
* rtnetlink (testing and bug reports appreciated!) - The routing netlink subsystem
* User defined netlink subsystems - `neli` can be extended to work with anything that can be modeled using the `Nl` trait

## Examples using `neli`

There is an `examples/` directory that is kept up to date with toy programs to play around with and look
at for inspiration. [pwrsurge](https://github.com/jbaublitz/pwrsurge) is also a good resource for a
more in depth usage of `neli`.

Workflows seem to usually follow a pattern of socket creation, and then either sending and receiving messages in
request/response formats:

```rust
extern crate neli;

use neli::consts::{CtrlAttr,CtrlCmd,GenlId,NlFamly,NlmF,Nlmsg};
use neli::genl::Genlmsghdr;
use neli::socket::NlSocket;

let mut socket = NlSocket::connect(NlFamily::Generic, None, None, true)?;

let attrs: Vec<Nlattr<CtrlAttr, Vec<u8>>> = vec![];
let genlhdr = Genlmsghdr::new(CtrlCmd::Getfamily, GENL_VERSION, attrs)?;
let nlhdr = {
    let len = None;
    let nl_type = GenlId::Ctrl;
    let flags = vec![NlmF::Request, NlmF::Dump];
    let seq = None;
    let pid = None;
    let payload = genlhdr;
    Nlmsghdr::new(len, nl_type, flags, seq, pid, payload)
};
socket.send_nl(nlhdr)?;

// Do things with multi-message response to request...
let mut iter = socket.iter::<Nlmsg, Genlmsghdr<CtrlCmd, CtrlAttr>>();
while let Some(Ok(response)) = iter.next() {
    // Do things with response here...
}

// Or get single message back...
let msg = socket.recv_nl::<Nlmsg, Genlmsghdr<CtrlCmd, CtrlAttr>>(None)?;

// and verify netlink protocol-level ACKs
socket.recv_ack()?;
```

or a subscriptions to a stream of event notifications from netlink:

```rust
extern crate neli;

use neli::{consts,socket};
use neli::genl::Genlmsghdr;

let mut s = socket::NlSocket::connect(consts::NlFamily::Generic,
                                      None, None, true)?;
let id = s.resolve_nl_mcast_group("my_family_name", "my_multicast_group_name")?;
s.set_mcast_groups(vec![id])?;
for next in s.iter::<u16, Genlmsghdr<u8, u16>>() {
    // Do stuff here with parsed packets...

    // like printing a debug representation of them:
    println!("{:?}", next?);
}
```

I plan to support both of these using a higher level API eventually.

## Contributing

Your contribution will be licensed under neli's [license](LICENSE). This is non-negotiable mainly
because, while some projects have legal counsel and additional help, this project is maintained by me.
I want to keep this aspect as simple as possible so please read over the license file prior to
contributing to make sure that you feel comfortable with your contributions being released under
the BSD 3-Clause License.

CI is awesome - please add tests for new features wherever possible. I may request this prior to merge
if I see it is possible and missing. Given that netlink is a messy, systems protocol, for features
that require actual netlink interaction, this is beyond the scope of CI for now (containers can make
this harder, netlink is moving to dynamic identifiers, etc.). All of this makes automated testing
a little too much for right now but a good rule of thumb is if you are writing an `Nl` impl,
please test that it works.

Please document new features not just at a lower level but also with `//!` comments at the module
for high level documentation and overview of the feature.

Before submitting PRs, take a look at the module's documentation that you are changing. I am
currently in the process of adding a "Design decision" section to each module. If you are
wondering why I did something the way I did, it should be there. That way, if you have a better
way to do it, please let me know! I'm always happy to learn. My hope is that this will also
clarify some questions beforehand about why I did things the way I did and will make your life
as a contributer easier.
